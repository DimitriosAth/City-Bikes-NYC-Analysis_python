# City Bikes NYC - Data Analysis project conducted in Python

## Objective

City Bike is New York City's bike share system, and the largest in the nation. My task is to perform an analysis of City Bike NYC data to uncover more information about its usage patterns, derive insights and suggest strategies for improving the service and increasing customer engagement.

## Key Questions

● How to best allocate bikes based on traffic and time of day?

● Where are the most popular destinations?

● What is the average make-up of our subscribers?

● Is there seasonality in bike usage?
